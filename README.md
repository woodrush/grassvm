# GrassVM
GrassVM is a programmable virtual CPU for the [Grass](http://www.blue.sky.or.jp/grass/) programming language (also see [here](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Grass)).

GrassVM supports an extended version of the [ELVM](https://github.com/shinh/elvm) instruction set and architecture written by [Shinichiro Hamaji](https://github.com/shinh).
Using GrassVM, you can enjoy assembly programming to write programs in the Grass programming language.

GrassVM is based on [LambdaVM](https://github.com/woodrush/lambdavm) and [LambdaCraft](https://github.com/woodrush/lambdacraft).
The implementation details for these projects are also available at the repos for [lambda-8cc](https://github.com/woodrush/lambda-8cc) and [LambdaLisp](https://github.com/woodrush/lambdalisp).


## How it Works
### Compilation Chain
GrassVM's compilation chain is based on [@susisu](https://github.com/susisu)'s [Grassy](https://github.com/susisu/Grassy) toolkit.
The toolkit includes `grass` and `plant`.
`grass` is a Grass interpreter.
`plant` is a Grass transpiler that transpiles an OCaml-style language to Grass.
For example programs for `plant`, see [Grasspiler](https://github.com/susisu/Grasspiler) written also by [@susisu](https://github.com/susisu).

### Having Lots of Fun
LambdaVM is first compiled to the OCaml-like `plant` syntax using LambdaCraft.
The output is a one-liner lambda term:

```ocaml
let main _ = (fun x -> fun y -> ((fun z -> ((fun a -> ((fun b -> (a (fun c -> (b b c))
)) (fun b -> (a (fun c -> (b b c)))))) (fun a -> fun b -> fun c -> fun d -> ((fun e ->
((fun f -> (f (fun g -> fun h -> fun i -> fun i -> fun k -> k) (fun g -> fun h -> g)))
e)) b (fun e -> (d c (Succ c))) (fun e -> (b (fun f -> fun g -> (a g c (fun h -> fun c
-> (a g c (fun j -> fun c -> (d (fun l -> (l h j)) c)))))))) (fun e -> e))) z ((fun a 
-> fun b -> ((fun a -> fun b -> ((fun a -> fun b -> (a (a b))) ((fun a -> fun b -> ((
...
```

This is generated by running [rot13.cl](src/rot13.cl) in Common Lisp.
This program generates the lambda term encodings for the assembly listing
and applies it to GrassVM, creating a standalone lambda term that can be run in a Grass interpreter
(after transpiling it with `plant`).
This file is saved as `out/rot13.ml`.
For the reason why `main` takes an unused argument, please see the language specs.

`out/rot13.ml` is then transpiled to Grass using `plant`.

### Writing Assembly in Raw Grass
In the previous section, the assembly was transpiled to lambda terms using `plant`.
You can also choose to directly write GrassVM assembly in raw Grass terms.
This is done in [asm.w](examples/asm.w), which is connected to `out/main.w`
which can be generated by `make out/main.w`.
The standalone Grass program can be built by `out/asm-standalone.w`.
This can be run by `make run-asm`.


### Evaluation Strategy
The original [LambdaVM](https://github.com/woodrush/lambdavm) assumes a lazy evaluation strategy.
On the other hand, Grass is an eagerly evaluated language as specified in the [language specs](http://www.blue.sky.or.jp/grass/) (in the "Intuitive explanation" section).
Several modifications were made to let LambdaVM run in an eager evaluation strategy.

### I/O Wrapper
GrassVM first creates a binary tree that stores all of the 256 characters from 0 to 255.
This structure is used to convert to and from Grass's primitive character object to a list of booleans.
Using this structure, it defines the functions `putchar` and `getchar` which is later referenced inside LambdaVM.
The definitions for these structures are written in [grassvm.cl](src/lambdavm.cl).

### Source Codes
The main source code for the virtual machine is [lambdavm.cl](src/lambdavm.cl).
The I/O wrapper is written in [grassvm.cl](src/lambdavm.cl).
The assembly listing is written in [rot13.cl](src/rot13.cl).
For details on the assembly, please see the [LambdaVM](https://github.com/woodrush/lambdavm) repo.


## Usage
### Requirements
- [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/), the Haskell Tool Stack (2.9.1)
- [SBCL](https://www.sbcl.org/) (2.1.11.debian)

### Build Instructions
This will build [rot13.w](https://gist.github.com/woodrush/360a4e741e40084b34ecfe3aa9e00c95) (without the newline pretty printing):

```sh
make
```

This will build the file `out/rot13.w`.
This will take several minutes.

Note that running `make` will also install `grass` and `plant`
under the location specified by `stack`.
The Makefile assumes `~/.local/bin` as the installation location,
specified with the configuration `STACK_BIN_PATH=~/.local/bin`.
If `make` fails finding `grass` and `plant`, try changing this configuration.

`out/rot13.w` can be run as:

```sh
$ make bin/grass
$ echo 'Hello, world!' | bin/grass rot13.w
Uryyb, jbeyq!
$ echo 'Uryyb, jbeyq!' | bin/grass rot13.w
Hello, world!
$ bin/grass rot13.w  # Also runs as a REPL
Hello, world!
Uryyb, jbeyq!
```
